# NPIPs

NavCoin Protocol Improvement Proposals   http://www.navcoin.org

People wishing to submit NPIPs, first should propose their idea or document as a PR to this repository. After reviewing that the format and style meets our guidelines and when acceptance and minimum consensus is reached, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving NPIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. The exception is in very rare cases of dispute resolution when a decision is contentious and cannot be agreed upon. In those cases, the conservative option will always be preferred.

Having a NPIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the NavCoin users (see also: economic majority).
